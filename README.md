# This is an example of command line utilities for Node.js

### If you want to work with the project locally, follow these steps:

1. `git clone <repo name>`
2. Go to the project folder
3. `npm install`
4. Next, you have several options for launching commands:

   - You can run the commands at once in this pattern - `node <file name> <command> [...args]`
     or
   - add- You can make this file executable and run it via cmd
     - for Linux - `chmod +x <file name>`
     - for Windows - add the path to the current directory to environment variables
     - for either system, execute - `npm link`

   You will then be able to run utilities in this manner:
   `cmd <command> [...args]`

This way you can get information about commands and options:
`node <file name> -help`
`node <file name> <command> -help`
or
`cmd <command> -help`

Commands: `current`, `add`, `sub`, `guess`

### Happy use!
